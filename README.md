This program existed as far back as 1973 and probably longer.
A 1973 man page for sky(6) appears in 4th Edtion UNIX.

See the man page for more details.

# Issues

This program requires you to copy the skytab data file to /usr/lib or adjust the code to expect it to be elsewhere.

It is not Y2K compliant.

This program is a historical curiosity not an example of good programming.
